**DAGs...!**<br>
    The **D**irected **A**cyclic **G**raphs or (Dags)  is a collection of all the tasks you want to run,
organized in a way that reflects their relationships and dependencies.<br>
    In this project the Dags are being run in python üêç

*To check the working of the dag*<br>
    once the dag is saved you have to close and run the *Airflow UI* again, for this you have to type 
the command 

            docker-compose down --volumes --remove-orphans  #used to clear all cache files
            docker-compose up --build   #used to start the airflow ui again

after this you should be able to see your dag in the airflow ui<br>
